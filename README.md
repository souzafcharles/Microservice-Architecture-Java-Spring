# Course: Microservices with Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and Netflix Eureka

***
▶️ Presented by Genilson Medeiros Martins | GM2 - Training and Consulting.
***

## System Overview:

<p align="justify">
This system implements a microservices architecture for managing bank accounts and transactions, as depicted in the provided diagram. It leverages the capabilities of the <code>Spring Boot</code> framework, incorporating key technologies such as <code>Spring Cloud</code> and <code>Netflix Eureka</code> to deliver a scalable and resilient solution.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The system employs a layered architecture, with the API Gateway providing an abstraction layer between clients and microservices. Service discovery and load balancing are crucial for ensuring scalability and high availability. The use of separate databases (<code>MySQL</code> and <code>MongoDB</code>) reflects the polyglot persistence approach, where each microservice can choose the most appropriate database technology.

## Project Microservice Architecture:

![Microservice Architecture](https://github.com/souzafcharles/Microservice-Architecture-Java-Spring/blob/main/account-service/src/main/resources/static/images/microservice-architecture.png)

The architecture comprises the following key components:

* **account-service:**
    * Manages customer account data stored in a MySQL database;
    * Provides RESTful APIs for account creation, retrieval, and validation;
    * Operates with redundancy across ports 8000 and 8001.
* **transaction-service:**
    * Handles bank transactions, storing transaction data in MongoDB;
    * Offers APIs for deposits, withdrawals, and inter-account transfers;
    * Utilises OpenFeign to communicate with the Account Service for account validation;
    * Operates with redundancy across ports 8080 and 8081.
* **discovery-service:**
    * Uses Netflix Eureka to enable service registration and discovery;
    * Facilitates dynamic service location and load balancing;
    * Operates on port 8761.
* **api-gateway:**
    * Acts as a single entry point for client requests;
    * Routes requests to the appropriate microservices;
    * Operates on port 8765.
* **load-balancing:**
    * Distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances of the Account and Transaction services to enhance
      performance and availability.
* **Client Apps:**
    * Represents client devices (e.g., desktops, mobile phones) that interact with the system via the API Gateway.
